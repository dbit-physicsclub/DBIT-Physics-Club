          couldn't distinguish between the acceleration of gravity or the
          acceleration from a rocket. If both situations look and feel the same,
          maybe they are the same. Maybe acceleration and gravity are

          That person wouldn't be able to distinguish between the acceleration
          of gravity or floating in space with no acceleration.

          A free fall feels the same as not accelerating.

            Treating gravity and acceleration as equivalent means that both
            situations are the same. The ball is at rest and the rocket is
            accelerating. The 9.8 m/s² we feel is caused by the Earth
            accelerating upward like a rocket!

                  I am not at rest. I am accelerating at up at 9.8 m/s² because

                  point of view would be that the space around the Earth is
                  compressing, but the atoms of the Earth resists this
                  compression. This means that the surface of the Earth is
                  constantly accelerating upwards.

                <p>
                  On Earth the only way to not accelerate up would be to fall.
                  Falling is when you are at rest.

        <div class="card-body">
          The equivalence of acceleration and gravity drove Einstein towards a
          new theory that would extend the scope of special relativity to
          include gravity. In 1915 Einstein completed his theory of general
          relativity. General relativity describes gravity as the curvature of
          space and time, or spacetime.
          <br />
          Spacetime is
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0QN6f3G4">curved</a> by
          energy. Gravitation occurs when a body tries to move in a straight
          line through curved spacetime.

          <br />
          <a href="..\special\index.html#mass-energy">Mass</a> is a type of
          potential energy, so it also curves spacetime.

           In the simulation above, classical gravitational potential energy is represented as warping a 2-D surface into a 3rd dimension.
            This isn't exactly the same math as general relativity, but it's a good analogy.
            <p>
              As bodies travel through curved space they follow the shortest distance between two points, a straight line.
              The pull of gravity is what a straight line through curved space looks like.
              Another example of a straight line through a curved space is the <a href="https://www.greatcirclemap.com/roadmap?routes=%20LAX-SIN%2C%20LAX-ATL%2C%20ATL-LON">great circle routes</a> around a sphere.

          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          The theory of general relativity suggests a significant change to fundamental aspects of physics,
          but there is overwhelming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity">evidence</a> in its favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          General relativity is currently the best description of gravity, but it doesn't include any quantum mechanical ideas, like wave particle duality.
          This isn't normally a problem because each theory operates at different scales.
          Quantum mechanics explains small and isolated bodies. General relativity explains very massive bodies.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Some extreme situations do require both.
          For example, black holes are both very small and very massive.
          Neither quantum mechanics or relativity alone can explain how they work.
          We hope that one day theoretical physicists will develop a "Grand Unified Theory" that combines both theories.
        </p>
  
        <h2 class='underlined' id="time">Gravitational Time Dilation</h2>
        <p>
          General relativity predicts that an accelerating reference frame experiences time dilation.
          This effect is similar, but different from how relative velocity dilates time in special relativity.
          <br>
          A big difference from special relativity is that acceleration based time dilation is consistent for all observers.
          This makes the acceleration based time dilation less complex.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          General relativity says that massive bodies curve the spacetime around them.
          This means an object in curved spacetime must accelerate to stay in the same position.
          This acceleration produces time dilation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          You can't feel <strong>time dilation</strong> inside an accelerating frame of reference,
          but observers outside the frame see everything inside as slower.
          People age slower and move slower. They talk slower, with deeper voices.
          Light originating inside a time dilated frame of reference has a lower frequency and a different color when observed from outside.
        </p>
  
        <h2 class='underlined'>Black Holes</h2>
        <p>
          Extremely dense masses can push the gravitational time dilation equation to the point of breaking when you have to take the square root of a negative number. We can find where the equation breaks down by solving for the radius where the time dilation approaches zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          This radius is called the Schwarzschild radius, or the <strong>event horizon</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Objects that achieve the high density needed to reach this point are called <strong>black holes</strong>. We can only speculate how black holes might behave, but the time dilation equation suggests very extreme outcomes.
          As a body approaches the event horizon, the passage of time approaches zero. From an outsider's perspective, objects fall into black holes and never get out, frozen in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://rantonels.github.io/starless/">Black holes</a> are a possible outcome at the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution">life</a> of a very massive star.
          Stars convert mass into energy through nuclear fusion. This energy balances the force of gravity and prevents stars from becoming black holes. When stars runs out of nuclear fuel, gravity will dominate and a black hole may form.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the center of most galaxies there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_GVbuddri8">super massive black hole</a>. Even our galaxy, the Milky Way, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF8THY5spmo">one</a> with a mass of 4 million Suns.</p>
        <p>
          An accurate black hole model probably needs a unified theory of physics that combines general relativity with quantum field theory.
          A grand unified theory of physics doesn't exist yet, but many physicists are actively looking for one.

      <h2 class='underlined' id="speed">A Constant Speed of Light</h2>
      <p>
        Waves are a disruption that propagates through a medium. The speed of a wave is constant and determined by
        the medium.
        Sound's medium is atoms. Light's medium is electric and magnetic fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Light</strong> is different from other waves.
        It moves faster than any known object, and it is able to propagate through the vacuum of space.
  
        How can a wave exist in seemingly empty space?
        Is space filled with a medium? What is the velocity of that medium relative to Earth?
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1887, scientists Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley developed an <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3GQM7tuq2w">experiment (How Luminiferous Aether Led to Relativity
          by PBS)</a>
        to learn about the relative velocity between the Earth and light's medium, electromagnetic fields.
      </p>
  
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment">
        <img src="Morley_experiment.png" alt="Morley_experiment">
      </a>
  
  
      <p>
        Michelson and Morley <strong>split</strong>
        a beam of light into two perpendicular paths. These separate beams reflected off mirrors to recombine again
        at the splitter.
        By looking at the interference pattern of the combined beams, they could tell with a high accuracy if either
        path took less time.
      </p>

      <p>
        They tested at different times of day and year to measure the effect of Earth's relative velocity on the
        speed of light.
        They always measured a constant speed of light in every direction. Earth's motion had no effect.
      </p>
      <div class="definition">
        <h1>$$c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{\tfrac{m}{s}} $$</h1>
        <p>
          All observers measure the speed of light as the same value even when moving at a relative velocity.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>Constant for all observers at any relative velocity.</p> -->
      </div>
      <p>
        It seems like a constant speed of light for all observers leads to a paradox.
        How can two observers moving relative to each other both see the speed of something as the same?

      <h2 class='underlined' id="specialrelativity">Special Relativity</h2>
      <p>
        The Michelson-Morley experiment and a few other experiments indicated that there was a problem with our
        understanding of relative velocity and light.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1905 Albert Einstein published his answer to the problem. He suggested special relativity as a
        modification of the laws of physics to take into account a constant speed of light. Special relativity
        suggests that space and time change for different observers in a way that keeps the speed of light constant.
      </p>
      <p> Special relativity is based on two postulates:
        <br> 1. The laws of physics are the same in all reference frames.
        <br> 2. Light moves at the same speed for all observers.
      <p>
        Special relativity predicts that observers moving at a relative velocity to each other don't agree on the:
        <li>order of events (simultaneity)</li>
        <li>passage of time (time dilation)</li>
        <li>length of objects (length contraction)</li>
        <li>mass of objects (mass–energy equivalence)</li>
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Because of the high speeds needed, special relativity is difficult to observe, but so far all <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_special_relativity">tests</a> support the theory to a high
        degree of precision.

            Effects like time dilation and length contraction have real consequences that all observers can

            You can already go <strong>forwards</strong> in time by just waiting, but you will get old.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a velocity near the speed of light relative to the Earth, you will age slow as the Earth
            ages fast. You could use this to see the far future, but right now we don't have a safe way to get a
            person up to relativistic speeds.

          <p>
            It is probably impossible to go <strong>backwards</strong> in time, but the equations don't

      <h2 class='underlined'>Lorentz factor</h2>
      <p>
        These equations predict how observers in two non-accelerating reference frames can disagree on space and
        time if they have a relative velocity.
      </p>
      $$ \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0 \quad \quad \quad \quad L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma}$$
      <p>
        Before we can solve these equations, we need to calculate the <strong>Lorentz factor</strong>, written as Ɣ
        (gamma).
        The Lorentz factor is used in special relativity equations to scale how different reference frames measure
        space and time.
      </p>
      <div class="definition">
        <h1>$$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} } }$$</h1>

        <br>\(c\) = speed of light, 3 × 10⁸ [m/s]
      </div>
      <p>The Lorentz factor is always greater than 1, but it grows towards infinity as the relative velocity
        approaches the speed of light.</p>
  
      <p>At a low relative velocity, the effects of special relativity aren't noticeable because the Lorentz factor is
        one. As the relative speed approaches the speed of light, the Lorentz factor increases towards infinity.</p>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVzDP8SMhPo">Muons</a> are elementary particles similar to
        electrons, but more massive.
        Muons are produced in Earth's upper atmosphere by <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=400xfGmSlqQ">cosmic rays</a>, but they have a half-life of 2.2
        microseconds.
        This means after 0.0000022 seconds half of a population of muons will decay into other particles.

      <h2 class='underlined'>Length Contraction</h2>
      <p>Length contraction only occurs in the direction of the relative velocity. Objects don't look smaller; they
        look shorter.</p>
      <div class="definition">
        <p>An observer sees lengths contracted along the relative velocity.</p>
        <h1>$$ L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma}$$</h1>
        \( L\) =
        <strong>contracted length</strong>, as seen from a relative velocity
        <br>\( L_0\) =
        <strong>rest length</strong>, as seen from its own rest frame
  
        <br>\( \gamma \) = Lorentz factor, gamma [no units]
      </div>
      <p>The rest length is always longer. An object will look contracted from a moving reference frame. </p>
  
  
  
  
  
      <h2 class='underlined' id="twin-paradox">Twin Paradox</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine there is a pair of twins names Apollo and Artemis.
        On the day they are born Artemis is taken to a spaceship destined for Alpha Centauri 4.37 light-years away.
        The spaceship travels at 0.8c.
        Meanwhile, Apollo lives a normal life on Earth.
      </p>
  
  
      <h2 class='underlined' id="mass-energy">Mass and Energy</h2>
      <p>
        One of the implications of special relativity is that mass is a type of energy.
        Mass is not the same as energy. Mass is a type of energy, just like how kinetic and gravitational potential
        are types of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We originally thought that mass produced gravity and had inertia.
        We now know that all types of energy have these properties,
        although it does take a large amount of energy to measure them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you add kinetic energy to an object it will have more gravity and more inertia.
        This also means that objects with no mass, like light, have inertia and gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oddly enough most of the energy of an atom is not in the mass of the particles in the atom.
        It comes from the binding energy of the strong nuclear force that keeps the quarks together.
      </p>
      <div class="definition">
        <h1>$$ E = \gamma mc^2$$ </h1>
        \( E\) = Energy [J]
        <br>\( \gamma \) = Lorentz factor, gamma [no units]
        <br>\( m \) = mass [kg]
        <br>\(c\) = speed of light, 3 × 10⁸ [m/s]
      </div>
      <p>
        At rest, the Lorentz factor is one.
        This gives us Einstein's famous equation for mass-energy equivalence at rest.
      </p>
      $$E = mc^2$$
  
      <p>
        Light has energy, so it produces and is affected by gravity.
        Of course, we don't normally need to include the energy of light in our calculates of gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inertia and gravity calculations are more accurate if the total energy is used.
        For example, increasing the temperature of an body will cause it to produce slightly more gravity.
      </p>
