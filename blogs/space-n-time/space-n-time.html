                        What is space? <br>
                        In astronomy, space refers to the vast and mostly empty expanse that surrounds planets, stars, and other celestial bodies. Space is typically defined as the region beyond the Earth's atmosphere, where there is no air or other matter to breathe, and where objects experience microgravity.
                        <br><br>
                        Space is often studied in terms of its properties and features, such as its temperature, density, and electromagnetic radiation. It is also studied in terms of the objects and phenomena that exist within it, such as planets, stars, galaxies, black holes, and cosmic rays.
                        <br><br>
                        The study of space is an important field in astronomy, as it can provide insights into the origins and evolution of the universe, the structure and behavior of celestial objects, and the fundamental laws of physics that govern the behavior of matter and energy.

                        What is time? <br>
                        In astronomy, time is a fundamental concept used to describe the motion of celestial objects and events. Astronomers use time to measure the duration of astronomical phenomena, such as the orbit of planets, the rotation of stars, and the movement of galaxies.
                        <br><br>
                        In general, time is defined as the measurement of the duration between two events. In astronomy, the primary unit of time is the second, which is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.
                        <br><br>
                        Astronomers also use other units of time, such as minutes, hours, days, and years, to measure the duration of astronomical events. For example, the sidereal day, which is the time taken by the Earth to complete one rotation with respect to the stars, is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds.
                        <br><br>
                        Moreover, in astronomy, time is often expressed in different time systems, including Universal Time (UT), Terrestrial Time (TT), and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), to account for the effects of Earth's rotation and orbit on time measurement.

                       How space and time is realeted?<br>
                       In astronomy, space and time are fundamentally related through the concept of spacetime. Spacetime is a mathematical model that combines the three dimensions of space with the fourth dimension of time, creating a four-dimensional fabric in which events occur.
                       <br><br>
                       According to the theory of relativity, space and time are not separate and independent entities, but are instead interwoven into a single fabric that is affected by the presence of mass and energy. This means that the passage of time can be affected by the presence of massive obje
                       cts, and that the geometry of space can be curved by the presence of gravity.
                       <br><br>
                       In astronomy, the relationship between space and time is essential for understanding the behavior of celestial objects, such as planets, stars, and galaxies. Astronomers use the concepts of spacetime and relativity to describe the motions of these objects, as well as the properties of the universe as a whole. By studying the interactions between space and time, astronomers are able to gain insights into the origins and evolution of the cosmos.
